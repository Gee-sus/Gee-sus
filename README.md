👋 Hi, I’m @Gee-sus
👀 I’m interested in building tech solutions that merge logistics and technology. I’m passionate about simplifying global trade through freight forwarding innovations, and I’m diving into LLMs, machine learning, and data science. I also enjoy exploring side projects like game development and data-driven apps.

🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development, focusing on python, html, css, django, flask & javaScript along with machine learning and data science. As a self-taught, autodidact programmer, I love figuring things out through hands-on projects.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve logistics tech, machine learning, and software engineering, as well as startups pushing the boundaries of tech and AI.

⚡ Fun fact: I moved to New Zealand after a pub bet, stayed to revolutionize the logistics industry, and founded Artemis Freight Forwarding. When I’m not coding or riding my motorcycle, I’m usually fueled by coffee, Yorkshire tea, and endless curiosity!
